# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
## Learning objectives
### General:
 - What is a search algorithm?
 - What is a linear search?
 - What is a binary search?
 - What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs


## Requirements
### General:
 - Editor: nvim
 - All file compiled on Ubunut 14.04 LTS
 - Programs and functions are compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
 - All files end in a new line
 - Call codes pass [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) linter coding style.
 - No global variables used
 - No more than 5 functions per file
 - Printf standar lib allowed only
 - Functions prototypes included in the header file ___search_algos.h___
